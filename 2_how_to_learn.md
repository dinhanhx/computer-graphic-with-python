# How to learn

For theoritical part, I recommend you read at least one of following books:
- [Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Graphics-Principles-Practice-3rd/dp/0321399528)
- [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1482229390/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_9CqVAbDNS1VMT)

For programming part, what you should know that:
- PyOpenGL is just the Python binding version of OpenGL. Therefore, the workflow of coding with OpenGL is **same** as with PyOpenGL. Names of functions, interfaces, parameters are same. You can search, read OpenGL documentation, tutorial in c++ then code with Python. 

- Number of lines of code could be very large because OpenGL is very primitve. 

Now you may ask why you need a random guy on internet to guide you PyOpenGL. I will also cover what's **not included** in [PyOpenGL Documentation](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/manual-3.0/index.html).
